# Word2Vec: Optimal Hyper-Parameters and Their Impact on NLP Downstream Tasks
Here you will find various codes undergoing dfferent stages of development, as they are implemented in on-going research.

Codes:
One source code file generates word2vec models while the other two are for downstream tasks (SA & NER).
